        Our classes focus on improving communication skills such as speaking and
        listening, which are imperative among entrance examinations for both
        higher education and firms, and we have established a reputation as Be
        Seen solutions for improving communication skills.Unlike Japanese
        language school for Japanese students, the basic policy of our school is
        "Teaching Japanese as a second language." Our doors are open to all
        students, regardless of race and national origin, who wish to learn the
        Japanese language and to understand Japan. We want to nurture students
        into balanced, international people who can fluently speak the living
        Japanese language and have a deep understanding of Japanese culture.
